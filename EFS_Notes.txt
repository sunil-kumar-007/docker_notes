======================
Elastic File System (EFS)
======================

-> AWS EFS lets you create scalable file storage to be used on EC2. 

-> You don’t have to bother about capacity forecasting as it can scale up or down on-demand.

===============================
Some of the EFS advantages are:
===============================

1) Fully managed by AWS
2) Low cost, pay for what you use
3) Highly available & durable service
4) Automatically scale up or down
5) Scalable performance


========================
Steps to work with EFS
========================
=> Login into the AWS console
=> Go to Services and select EFS under storage
=> click Custoize
=>Mount target- choose- Zone => 1a and 1b
=>Security group default- next
=> Click on “Create file system.”

=======================
Mounting EFS on EC2
======================

Before mounting, you need to install the NFS client. If you expand the list and click on “Amazon EC2 mount instructions”, you will get the details.


# Login to EC2 instance and install the NFS client

$ sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils

# Let’s create a folder where you want to mount the EFS.

$ sudo mkdir efsdir

#  Mount EFS Filesystem (Make sure you changed FileSystem ID)
$ sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-0a37cdf9d7d2d8f82:/ efsdir

Note: Make EC2 VM security Group inbound rule having "NFS" protocol with 2049 port number

# Change the directory to the mount point that is created above using the command:

$ cd efsdir

# Create a new sub directory with following command:

$ sudo mkdir begin

# Change the permissions of the above subdirectory with the following command:

# sudo chown ec2-user begin

# Change the directory to begin directory with following command:

$ cd begin

# Create a sample text file:

$ touch myfile.txt

# Run ls command to list the contents of directory.

============================================================
Note: Create another ec2 instance and mount EFS file system 
============================================================

# Login to EC2 instance and install the NFS client

$ sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils

# Let’s create a folder where you want to mount the EFS.

$ sudo mkdir efsdir

# Mount EFS Filesystem (Make sure you changed FileSystem ID)
$ sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-00fc4e2c6aee19e2e:/ efsdir

# Change the directory to the mount point that is created above using the command:

$ cd efsdir

# check the files available

$ ls 

Note : The files we have created in First EC2 instance, should display in second ec2 instance.
